## ðŸ›  Methods and Techniques  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data for clustering.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding variable distributions and relationships.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting relevant features for clustering.  
- **K-Means Clustering:** Using the Elbow Method to find the optimal `k` value.  
- **Cluster Profiling:** Analyzing the characteristics of each customer segment.  
- **Business Recommendations:** Providing insights based on cluster behaviors.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
- Cluster 1 consists mainly of high-income married individuals.  
- Cluster 2 includes younger, single customers with high spending behavior.  
- Cluster 3 represents a highly educated but low-engagement segment.  
- Cluster 4 consists mainly of lower-income customers with minimal transactions.  
- Cluster 5 is a niche group with unique characteristics requiring a specialized approach.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook
